Bulk Archive
============

For a period of time items marked for delete failed to delete (out of disk space, broken lucene indexes, etc).

The bulkarchive script takes two parameters; a filename containing configurationand a filename containing a list of newline separated node references to mark for delete and then immediately archive.
