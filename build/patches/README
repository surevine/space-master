HOW TO CREATE A PATCH FOR ALFRESCO


1)  Write your patch as a bash script
2)  Put you bash script into a working directory with the following files (TODO:  Jenkins Job?)
    * patch_alfresco.sh
    * integration.properties
    * shell.properties
    * version.html
    * version.properties
    * modify-properties.sh
    * any other files your patch needs
3)  Edit version.properties by hand
4)  Edit the line at the top of patch_alfresco.sh to point at the script you have created for your patch
5)  Zip up the directory
6)  Test the patch - you should simply be able to unzip the patch zip file, then run ./patch_alfresco.sh integration.properties - no need to restart or backup alfresco, the script will do it for you
7)  Upload the patch to nexus to distribute to the customer.  See the branching and versioning strategy on the wiki for details of where to upload it to

There isn't a patch_share.sh at the time of writing but if you need one, just create it - simply a matter of changing the target .war file

While writing your script use "exit 5" to bug out if something is wrong
